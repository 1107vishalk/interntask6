# Password Security Lab

##  Objective
To test multiple passwords with different complexity levels, evaluate their strength using online tools, and understand how complexity affects security.

---

##  Passwords Tested
- `password123` (weak)
- `Vishal2025` (medium)
- `Vi$h@lK_2025#` (strong)
- `T!me2LearnCyberSecur!ty2025` (very strong)



##  Best Practices Learned
- Use **12–16+ characters** minimum.
- Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid common words, names, or predictable sequences.
- Do **not reuse passwords** across accounts.
- Use a **password manager** to generate and store strong, unique passwords.

---

##  Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force** → Tries every possible combination.  
- **Dictionary Attack** → Uses common words/password lists.  
- **Credential Stuffing** → Reuses leaked credentials from breaches.  
- **Phishing** → Tricks users into giving away passwords.  

---

##  Conclusion
Password complexity directly impacts how long it would take to crack.  
- Weak passwords = seconds.  
- Medium = hours/days.  
- Strong/very strong = years to centuries.  

Stronger, unique passwords greatly reduce the risk of attacks.
